section_title: Getting started with Jekyll

---

The mid term break has finally come around which meant I had a decent chunk of time to dedicate to learning Jekyll. I had used Jekyll in project the previous semester and in Multimedia during second year but had to learn it from the ground up this time for the Theta site to function the way I wanted it to.  

To set up Jekyll I used:

    Jekyll Serve

This command built my site and created a second version in the _site directory. This allows me to run the website locally on a development server making it easy to see changes.
