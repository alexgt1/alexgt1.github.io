section_title: Getting started with Jekyll

---

The mid term break has finally come around which meant I had a decent chunk of time to dedicate to learning Jekyll. I had used Jekyll in project the previous semester and in Multimedia during second year but had to learn it from the ground up this time for the Theta site to function the way I wanted it to.  

Seeing as I had already built the various pages for the website I could now set up Jeyll

To set up Jekyll I used:

    Jekyll Serve

This did a build of my site to _site folder and runs a local development server at http://localhost:4000 by default. Any changes we make to a site (except edits to  _config.yml) trigger the site to rebuild and the development server to refresh. This command is typically used while youâ€™re developing a site as it automatically builds and serves your site locally after a change.
