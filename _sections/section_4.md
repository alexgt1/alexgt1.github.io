section_title: Getting started with Jekyll

---

The mid term break has finally come around which meant I had a decent chunk of time to dedicate to learning Jekyll. I had used Jekyll in project the previous semester and in Multimedia during second year but had to learn it from the ground up this time for the Theta site to function the way I wanted it to.  

Seeing as I had already built the various pages for the website I could now set up Jeyll

To set up Jekyll I used:

    Jekyll Serve

This did a build of my site to _site folder and runs a local development server.
