section_title: First meeting with Adon

---

Had my first meeting with Adon today, a non profit organisation called THETA got in contact regarding the possibility of having a website made that would cost them less to maintain than their current one.

At the moment they use an agency for all the changes they want to be made to the site which ends up costing them money for each individual change.

Adon suggested I look into building them a new site using Jekyll and hosting it for free in GitHub.
