section_title: Meeting with Grant from THETA

---

Had my first meeting with Grant today. It was good to be able to meet with the client to get a better understanding of the current websites situation.

Their current website has a content management system however it is very limited in functionality and only allows for the main body content to be edited. Grant has no control of the finer details such as changing the address, email or phone number and therefore has to pay more to get these updated each year.

The main take aways from the meeting were that I had to build a website that would allow for greater control over details such as these. As well as this I will have to put together some documentation for Grant as coming to terms with MarkDown in GitHub will be an adjustment from the current layout of THETA's backend which is in SilverStripe.  

Grant was happy with the current progress on the new site and was surprised at how similar the new site looked to their current one. 

I briefly showed him how MarkDown worked in GitHub and he seemed to be comfortable with having to learn this once the new site was live.
