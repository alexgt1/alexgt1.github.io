One problem encountered when using a background that covers the full size of the screen is losing site of the navigation bar when scolling further down the page.
As the navbar for this website was fixed it would often get lost in the images or other colors when scrolling further down the page.

I decided to use JavaScript to counteract this problem and made it so the navbar would become dark blue when the user started scrolling, allowing for a clear view of the navigation bar at all times

pictured here is the css for the nav bar. At the top of the page the background is transparent, this quickly changes to dark blue as the page background varies in color the further down you scroll.

I used the following JavaScript code to monitor the users scrolling and when they got to a certain point on the site change the colour of the background from transparent to blue.
