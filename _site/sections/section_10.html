<p>I got in touch with Grant to arrange a second meeting. As I had more a less finished the website I thought it would be appropriate to arrange a follow up meeting with Grant to discuss the site and any further input he might have.</p>

<p>It was a good chance to show him how to use the back end of the website, which was now in CloudCannon as well where to find the documentation I’d prepared for him.</p>

<p>Overall Grant was really pleased with the progress of the site and was stoked to no longer have to deal with the one off fees for site maintenance.</p>

<p>My next and possibly final task for the THETA website is finalizing the registration form. I got Grant to send me an image of what their current contact form looks like when submitted so I have something to go off.</p>

<p>Besides this the websites is complete.</p>

<p><strong>Where to from here?</strong></p>

<p>I will look to arrange a final meeting with Grant to give him and a few other members of THETA a walkthrough of how the site works as well as transfering the domain name to theta.org.nz which they currently use.</p>

<p>Due to time constraints I’m unsure if this meeting will happen during the remaining weeks of term or not.</p>

<p>Overall I have really enjoyed putting the website together and enjoyed dealing with a real life client, this will no doubt give me good experience moving forward.</p>
