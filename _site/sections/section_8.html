<p>Collections are a useful way to organize related content in Jekyll.</p>

<p>The general consensus for using collections is if the things in your collection can be logically grouped and aren’t grouped by date (in this case you would use a post instead).</p>

<p>In total I figured out I would need close to 10 different collections of content across the website. Some of which included the about section, programme section and resource section.</p>

<p>I defined my collections in the _config.yml file pictured below</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>collections:
	programmes:
	output: true
	resources:
	output: true
	about:
	output: true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The items/documents within a collection live in a folder in the root of the site. This folder is named after the specific collection name. e.g. for programmes the folder name would be _programmes</p>

<p>The items in each folder are also written in markdown and can specify variables such as layout and title the same as any other markdown file.</p>

<p>By specifying <strong>output: true</strong> in _config.yml for each collection it means that Jekyll will create a page for each document.</p>

<p>While this isn’t neccessary for every collection it was very useful for the likes of the programme collection as these did require their own page for each programme.</p>

<p>Pictured: the Programmes collection. I was able to use a control flow statement to display each of the programmes in the Programmes collection in the navigation bar and open each programme in a new page when clicked.</p>
