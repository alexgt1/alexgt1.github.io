<p>Today I added the layouts to each page, I was able to do this using front matter.</p>

<p>Front matter is used to set variables and metadata on Jekyll sites and is a good way to reduce code duplication across pages.</p>

<p>I used front matter on the home page of the website to specify the content of the page slider</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
 
layout: homepage
back_to_top: show
slide1_title: Seen our show?
slide1_caption:
slide1_link_text: Take our Sexwise survey
slide1_link: 'https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/97FFZJC'
slide1_image: /img/1.jpg
slide2_title: THETA promotes the development of &lt;br/&gt;healthy attitudes and behaviours.
