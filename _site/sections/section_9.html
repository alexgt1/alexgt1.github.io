<p>The inital plan for this project was to get the backend up and running in GitHub but having used CloudCannon tutorials religiously to get the site up and running, I was intrigued to try their content management system to see if it could be of use to Grant and other members of THETA who didnâ€™t have the technical exprience suitable for navigating GitHub.</p>

<p>I set a CloudCannon account for THETA and started to sync the websites repository.</p>

<p>The process was seamless and CloudCannon set up the various site pages and collections in a similar way to how files would be displayed in other content management systems such as WordPress or SilverStripe. I thought this was very convenient as the THETA sites current back end was a SilverStripe CMS which meant the transition to the CloudCannon CMS would be straightforward for Grant.</p>
