          <h1>First meeting with Adon</h1>
          <p><p>Had my first meeting with Adon today, a non profit organisation called THETA got in contact regarding the possibility of having a website made that would cost them less to maintain than their current one.</p>

<p>At the moment they use an agency for all the changes they want to be made to the site which ends up costing them money for each individual change.</p>

<p>Adon suggested I look into building them a new site using Jekyll and hosting it for free in GitHub.</p>

          <h1>Building the foundation</h1>
          <p><p>Today I started working on the foundations of the Theta website.</p>

<p>The physical appearance of their website was okay so I decided I would replicate the design instead of creating a new theme from scratch.</p>

<p>Using Bootstrap to create a responsive page layout.</p>

          <h1>Meeting with Grant from THETA</h1>
          <p><p>Had my first meeting with Grant today. It was good to be able to meet with the client to get a better understanding of the current websites situation.</p>

<p>Their current website has a content management system however it is very limited in functionality and only allows for the main body content to be edited. Grant has no control of the finer details such as changing the address, email or phone number and therefore has to pay more to get these updated each year.</p>

<p>The main take aways from the meeting were that I had to build a website that would allow for greater control over details such as these. As well as this I will have to put together some documentation for Grant as coming to terms with MarkDown in GitHub will be an adjustment from the current layout of THETA’s backend which is in SilverStripe.</p>

<p>Grant was happy with the current progress on the new site and was surprised at how similar the new site looked to their current one.</p>

<p>I briefly showed him how MarkDown worked in GitHub and he seemed to be comfortable with having to learn this once the new site was live.</p>

          <h1>Getting started with Jekyll</h1>
          <p><p>The mid term break has finally come around which meant I had a decent chunk of time to dedicate to learning Jekyll. I had used Jekyll in project the previous semester and in Multimedia during second year but had to learn it from the ground up this time for the Theta site to function the way I wanted it to.</p>

<p>I’d found Jekyll to be fairly limited when using it in the past and didn’t see the point in changing from basic HTML and CSS.</p>

          <h1>Creating multiple page layouts to reduce code repetition</h1>
          <p><p>Going off the original THETA website there were about 4 different page layouts. I built the 4 page layouts in HTML &amp; CSS and was then able to use Jekyll to allocate the layouts to specific pages.</p>

<p>In the process of looking up Jekyll tutorials I stumbled across CloudCannon, who happen to be a Dunedin based Jekyll CMS. They also have an array of useful Jekyll tutorials which helped me a lot to get the site up and running.</p>

<p>I found this tutorial particularly useful for setting up the page layouts.</p>

          <h1>Second meeting with Grant</h1>
          <p><p>As I had more a less finished the website I thought it would be appropriate to arrange a follow up meeting with Grant to discuss the site and any further input he might have.</p>

<p>It was a good change to show him how to use the back end of the website, which was now in CloudCannon as well where to find the documentation I’d prepared for him.</p>

<p>Overall Grant was really pleased with the progress of the site and was stoked to no longer have to deal with the one off fees for site maintenance.</p>

<p>My next and possibly final task for the THETA website is finalizing the registration form. I got Grant to send me an image of what their current contact form looks like when submitted so I have something to go off.</p>

<p>Besides this the websites is complete.</p>

<p><strong>Where to from here?</strong></p>

<p>I will look to arrange a final meeting with Grant to give him and a few other members of THETA a walkthrough of how the site works as well as transfering the domain name to theta.org.nz which they currently use.</p>

<p>Due to time constraints I’m unsure if this meeting will happen during the remaining weeks of term or not.</p>

<p>Overall I have really enjoyed putting the website together and enjoyed dealing with a real life client, this will no doubt give me good experience moving forward.</p>
