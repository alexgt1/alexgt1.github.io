At the beginning of the project I'd decided to have a main page and then indiviudal pages for each project. 

After some consideration, I decided it would infact be more practical to have one page for the whole site which displays all the various project groups.

Every project will have their own image box which the user can click on if they're interested in seeing what the project is about. From here, a modal window will open up with information on that project. I thought this was a good way to display the information as it would reduce the loading time experienced when loading up a new page and would in turn allow more people to use the page as it would be less complicated and people could move on faster. 

For the modal window I went with the large modal which is part of the BootStrap 4 library.

The user can click on any of the below image boxes. The image box is linked to a modal which expands to the width of the page.

Here is how the modal looks when it expands.

For the page colour scheme I kept it aligned with the branding guidelines on the polytech website
