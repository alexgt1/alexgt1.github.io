section_title: Adding Extra Features

---

I've added about us much as I can to the site at this point and am just waiting on some content for each of the projects.

I spent todays class touching up some of the features and adding extras where I thought it was necessary.

This included using some javascript to implement a back to the top button.

Pictured below is the code I used for the button itself. As well as this I added the ID 'page-top' to the body tag.

Below is the styling I used.
