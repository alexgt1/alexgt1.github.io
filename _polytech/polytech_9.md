Overall I found this project to be the most rewarding out of the three sites I put together. This was largely due to the fact that it was for the Polytech itself so I felt obliged to put in more effort to make it look authentic both in terms of the interface and the experience the user gets from using the site. If there were any takeaways from the project it would be that the best way to get inspiration is to browse other sites and pick and choose components that you think would be applicable to the site you're working on. As well as this it was good to use Bootstrap again, this time round I feel as though I managed to get the site responsiveness to a point where the website not only displays on phones but displays each section clearly and tidily regardless of device.
