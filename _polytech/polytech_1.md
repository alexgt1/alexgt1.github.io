Had a meeting with Adon regarding putting together a website for the Bachelor of Information Technology project.

The objective was to give people a look into what actually goes on in third year project and give people a look into some of the projects they could be apart of if they did the degree. 

I spent the rest of the class figuring out how I'd design the site. I was fortunate enough to come across an album of BIT photos from showcase last year.
