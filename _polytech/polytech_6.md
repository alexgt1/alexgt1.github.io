section_title: Putting My Photoshop Skills To The Test

---

One area of the website I struggled with was the about us section. It was easy enough adding the written content but I wasn't sure of what I should display in the way of imagery. I tried using some of the photos I'd found in the Flickr album but the fact that they were square didn't really complememnt the text in the column beside it too well.

After looking for inspiration on a number of other sites I decided to have a go at cropping the images so that they were circular instead of square. I used Photoshop for this.

I held down the shift key when I was selecting the area of the image that I wanted to crop, this helps to keep the dimensions for height and width the same.

Once I had the dimesnions of the image selected I clicked *Select Inverse* this feature selects everything apart from the area that I had initally selected.

After this I clicked delete to remove this part of the image, which left me with a circular render of the original image.
