section_title: Creating an Eye Catching Contact Section Using RGBA

In project a lot of the projects are for real world clients so I thought it would be practical to add a contact section where people and businesses can put forward potential projects that they need help on.

When the user clicks the contact button a modal appears allowing the user to send a message.
