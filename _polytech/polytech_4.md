section_title: Setting up Image Boxes for Projects

---
Spent todays class putting together the image boxes for each of the projects.
There will be two rows with 6 different projects in total.

Below is the basic skeleton of each box.

I added a hover effect to each of the boxes so that when the user hovers over top of a box a line slides across along with the name of the project.

From here the user can click into the project which opens up as a modal window.
