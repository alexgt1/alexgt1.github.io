section_title: Setting up the slideshow

---

I opted for a background slideshow for the header of the site. This conistsed of 5 different images from the Polytech and Project.

I found this CSS based slideshow on the CodeDrops website and decided to base mine off of it.

The slideshow also came with documentation which made it easy to implement as it addressed each part of the code.

As there was a fair amount of code to quickly summarise the process I used an unordered list for the slideshow and added a span for each image and a division with a heading. The spans are the elements that hold background images of the slideshow.
